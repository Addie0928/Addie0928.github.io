My name is Addie Zhang, I am a Car hmi designer for more
than 3 years. I like interaction design，cause I am happy
to see my work used by many people.

There are lots of limitations in real projects, 
which prevent us from being creative. So, as a designer, we need 
to 
*balance creativity and limitations, turn inspiration into reality*.
