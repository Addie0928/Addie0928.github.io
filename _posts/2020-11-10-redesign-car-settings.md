This project is an information architecture redesign. We used tree testing
to evaluate framework A and B. The initial version framework called A, and 
the updated version called B.

这个项目是信息框架重设计,我们用"树状测试"去评估方案A和方案B。将初始方案叫做A,把更新方案叫做B.

   # Background
   
   After testing the initial car setting interface in the real car,
   we found that user cannot find some specific functions, and complete 
   the tasks with a high error rate. Therefore, the information architecture 
   needs to be optimized. Here are some issues as follows:
   
   我们将初始方案在真车上测试后，发现用户找不到一些具体的功能，完成任务时出错率较高。因此，
   信息框架需要进一步优化。一些需要解决的问题如下：

   # Competitive analysis
   
   In order to get a better optimization proposal, we did the competitive 
   product analysis to understand the current market car and their HMI system.
   Some advantages have been discovered:
   
   为了能得到更好地优化方案，我们进行了竞品分析，了解目前市场车机系统。从中发现了许多可取之处：
