## Purpose：
Evaluate participants experience with main interaction in our HMI (DIM, HUD, CSD) to find opinions and usability problems with the main interactions in our HMI. Usability of the framework.

评估测试者对HMI界面（仪表、抬头显示、中控）的总体交互体验，了解他们对主交互的观点，发现框架的可用性问题。

## Parameters of Usability：

![Usability](/assets/img/sample/06_usability/2_usability.png)
#### **Affordance** 可供性，功能可见性

- How many tries the participants need to do to complete a task or if help from test leader is needed, if so, how many times? 参与者完成任务需要尝试几次？如果是需要主持人帮助，帮助了几次？

#### **Learnability** 易学性
- If do a similar task (media vs. phone call), if participant can find the way easily. 如果是做类似任务，参与者是否能很快找到？
- If they understands the model easily after done it once. 能否做完一次就很容易地理解整个框架？
- If they get the overall image about the how the system works. 能否理解整体系统是如何运作的？zj

#### **Efficiency** 效率
- If participant think it takes too many steps or too much effort to accomplish a task, especially during driving. 参与者是否感到在完成任务时用了太多步骤，或是耗费太多努力？特别是在驾驶过程中。


#### **Error recovery** 错误恢复
- If participant find way back if he/she make a mistake,if he/she feels comfortable about making mistakes and always being able to recover. 参与者在犯错时是否可以找到恢复方法，在他犯错时是否感到舒适，是否每次犯错后都可以找到恢复方法。


#### **Subjective satisfaction** 主观满意度
- In general how participant feel about the system, preference, suggestions, etc. 参与者对系统的整体感受、偏好、建议等 。

---

## Components that we want to test:
#### **Overall logic** 整体逻辑
- Function division and relation (mental model, so where to find what in the whole system). 功能划分和关系(心智模型，整个系统中，从什么地方找什么功能) 

#### **CSD framework** 中控框架
- Where to find what, navigate on CSD or main interaction。从什么地方找什么功能，怎么找到导航，和其他主交互。
- Open/close smart area, climate pane, setting pane, etc. 如果打开/关闭智能区域、空调面板，设置面板。

#### **HUD framework** 抬头显示框架
- Where to find what 从什么地方找什么功能

#### **User input** 用户输入
- steering wheel switch interaction with HUD 方向盘操控抬头显示

#### **DIM framework** 仪表框架
- what can be seen on DIM 在仪表上能看到什么

---
## Main questions:
**1. If the user know where to look for information.
2. If information becomes redundant ?
3. What does it mean by ‘division of the same function’? Is it different from ‘separation of information’?**
- How do the participants experience the separation of information in and between the screens (DIM/HUD/CSD)? 参与者对于屏幕间（中控/抬头显示/仪表）的分立的信息感受如何？
- How do the participants experience division of the same function between DIM and HUD with different level of information?  参与者对于同样的功能在仪表和抬头显示的信息层级、分布不同，感受如何？
- Do the participants understand that they can only interact with the HUD and how do they experience it? 用户是否能理解只能与抬头显示交互，感受如何？

* * *

**If user can learn quickly how to interact with the system.**
- How do the participants experience the SWS interaction?
- How do the participants experience the interaction with the infotainment menu in the HUD?
- How do the participants experience the interaction with ADAS in the HUD?
- Do the participants understand the settings structure interface?
- How does the participants experience the split screen app interaction?
- Do the participants understand that they should use the home button to come back and do they understand that navi is the home view?
- Do the participants understand that they should use the menu button to come back?


## Goal：

The goal is to use the output from the clinic to confirm or update the current HMI to create a pleasant and usable HMI.
诊断用户输出，确认或者更新当前的HMI框架，以创造可用的、令人愉悦的HMI.

## Method：

#### Test method
Open observation of participants performing predefined tasks in a prototype with [**think aloud**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/) and [**semistructured interview**](http://www.qualres.org/HomeSemi-3629.html). 开放性地观察参与者在模型上操作设定好的任务, 鼓励用户发声，采取半访谈式。

#### Participants
- The test should include at least 12 participants ( >5 in China and >5 in Sweden) with a variation of gender and age. All participants should have a driver license.
- The participants should have experience from driving in the place where the test is performed (China respectively Europe).

#### Test environment
The test will be performed in a standing still car or a rig with a setup of 3 screens (DIM/HUD/CSD) and steering wheel switches. No driving simulator will be used.

#### Test time
The test will take approximately x min.

#### Documentation
Input will be collected through notes together with video and audio recording.

#### Analyze method
The test should be analyzed in a qualitative way, meaning that results could be made.

## General observation points:
- Can the participant perform the task without guidance? (what kind of guidance is the test leader giving)
- Does the participant make any errors/wrong steps?
- Does the participant make any unnecessary steps?
- Where is the participant searching to complete the task?
- Does the participant use swipe or press for interaction with the SWS?
- How does the participant seem to be feeling during the task (irritated, stressed, happy etc.)?
- What design features help them to accomplish tasks

## Preparation
- Set up the prototype and make sure it works.
- Ensure that there is only one user, one test leader, and 1 note taker in the room at each test.
- Make sure to include a printed consent release form (only in Sweden?).

## Test tasks
- Set up the prototype and make sure it works.
- Ensure that there is only one user, one test leader, and 1 note taker in the room at each test.

#### Introduction
- Briefly introduce the purpose and time of the test. Explain the roles of the people attending (host and note-taker)
- Ask for consent to record with video and audio. Make the participant sign the consent release form (only in Sweden?).
- Explain to the participants that the test is to try out the concept, not the participants performance, and that we are very thankful for all input and criticism we can get to improve the concept.
- Explain the input areas and interaction (for example the SWS interactive areas on the phones, the touch on the CSD and so on).
- Explain that the participant may find buggs in the prototype and that we will tell when they occur, so they know it’s not their fault.
- Explain the “think aloud protocol” to the participant.
- Ask if the participant has any additional questions.
 
#### Basic information
- Gender, Age,Occupation:
- Do you have a driver license? (for how long)
- What car do you drive the most? (year, brand)
- How often do you drive (daily, 3-4 times per week, 1-2 times per week, few times per month, less)?
- Which functions do you interact with in a cars infotainment system and active safety system?
- How often do you use the functions just mentioned above?
- Are you familiar with the HMI in other Lynk&Co cars? (which ones)

## Test scenarios
#### Step 1. Free exploration 5min
**Let the user feel free to play around with the demo and ask them to speak out loud what they think.**

**Guide to support participant think out loud:**
- What do you see?
- What you think you can do?

**Observation points:**

* Do the participant notice that interaction with SWS happens in HUD.
* Do the participants notice swiping interaction and pressing interaction at SWS.
* Do the participant discover smart area / setting / home button / climate control on CSD.

 
**Questions:**
- What do you think about the system now?
- Can you tell me your overall understanding of the system?


#### Task 1

- How easy/difficult was it to start playing the music?
- Why did you choose to do this in HUD/CSD?
 
**Observation points:**
- Does the participant use the CSD or SWS to complete the task.

#### Task 2
If participant used CSD, then ask him/her to use SWS and vice versa.

**Question:**
- How easy/difficult was it to find the function this time? Can you explain why?
- How easy/difficult was it to start playing the music this way? (very easy/very difficult?)
